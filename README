LaBaaooM is an oral reading fluency assessment tool designed for 7" Android tablets.

This began as a Master's semester project at Georgia Institute of Technology (CS6460)
in the fall of 2017. 

The repo should contain all of the necessary code and surrounding Android Studio bits
to build and extend the application.  The project was a learning experience both in
terms of the subject matter (reading fluency) and in the development of an Android
application.  There are lots of things that could be done differently/better from 
an Android point of view.
